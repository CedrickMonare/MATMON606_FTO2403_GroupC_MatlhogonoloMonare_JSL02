In this project we had to debug a fitness app, initially users could add the same goal multiple times so we had to prevent users from adding the same goal more than once. I used functions such as queryselectorall, for loop and return. It wasn't too complex but definitely a bit tricky at the start and I believe I achieved the necessary goal.
